title: Designing Effective Birthright and IT Roles in SailPoint for Large Organizations
---


In SailPoint IdentityIQ (IIQ) implementation for a large organization, it is important to define both **Birthright Roles** and **IT Roles** strategically. Here's a breakdown of each:

### **Birthright Roles**
Birthright roles are automatically assigned to users based on their attributes (e.g., department, location, job title). These are often used to provision basic access required for employees to perform their roles from the start.

#### **Suggested Birthright Roles for a Large Organization**
1. **Basic Employee Role**
    - Access to the organizationâ€™s intranet.
    - Email account creation.
    - Basic communication tools (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams).
    - Access to HR systems for self-service functions (leave requests, pay stubs).
    - Directory access (e.g., LDAP or AD) for organization-wide contact lookup.

2. **Department-Specific Roles**
    - **HR Role:** Access to HR applications like payroll, performance management systems.
    - **Finance Role:** Access to basic financial tools, budget management systems.
    - **Marketing Role:** Access to marketing automation tools, CRM.
    - **IT Support Role:** Access to ticketing systems, documentation portals.
    - **Engineering Role:** Access to version control (e.g., GitLab, GitHub), DevOps tools, code repositories.

3. **Location-Based Role**
    - Access to location-specific systems (e.g., access to certain network drives or facilities).
    - Region-specific HR or legal resources.

4. **Manager Role**
    - Access to employee management tools (approval workflows, performance management).
    - Delegation capabilities and reporting.

5. **Temporary/Contractor Role**
    - Time-limited access to systems relevant to specific projects.
    - Restricted permissions to sensitive information or corporate assets.

6. **New Hire Role**
    - Access to onboarding materials.
    - Limited temporary access to common systems until role assignment.

### **IT Roles**
IT roles provide access to specific applications and infrastructure management tools. These roles are typically assigned based on specific job functions in the IT department and require elevated privileges.

#### **Suggested IT Roles for SailPoint Implementation**
1. **Help Desk Role**
    - Access to user management tools (password resets, account unlock).
    - Limited administrative rights on systems to troubleshoot basic IT issues.

2. **Network Administrator Role**
    - Access to network management tools (firewalls, routers, switches).
    - Ability to provision network resources like VLANs, VPNs.
    - Access to network monitoring systems.

3. **Database Administrator Role**
    - Full access to manage databases (e.g., Oracle, MySQL).
    - Role-based restrictions on certain sensitive databases.
    - Access to backup and disaster recovery tools.

4. **System Administrator Role**
    - Full administrative access to operating systems (Windows, Linux).
    - Control over user accounts and permissions at the OS level.
    - Access to system monitoring and performance tools.

5. **Application Administrator Role**
    - Admin access to specific business applications (e.g., CRM, ERP, HRMS).
    - Ability to configure and manage roles within those applications.
    - Manage application updates and performance.

6. **DevOps Role**
    - Access to CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI).
    - Infrastructure management (e.g., AWS, Azure, Kubernetes clusters).
    - Access to development and production environments.

7. **Security Administrator Role**
    - Access to security monitoring tools (SIEM, IDS/IPS systems).
    - Privileged access to configure security policies (firewall rules, encryption).
    - Ability to manage user access audits and incident response.

8. **Identity Administrator Role**
    - Full access to SailPoint IdentityIQ for managing roles, provisioning, and deprovisioning.
    - Audit and review permissions across the organization.
    - Ability to create and modify certification campaigns.

9. **Access Reviewer Role**
    - Assigned to managers or security teams to review user access periodically.
    - Ability to certify access or flag anomalies for review.

10. **Compliance Auditor Role**
- Read-only access to reports on user access and policy compliance.
- Ability to generate and review compliance reports for audits.

When designing these roles, it's essential to maintain a balance between security (least privilege principle) and the usability for employees. Tailor these roles based on organizational needs, regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR, SOX), and the specific structure of the IT environment.
